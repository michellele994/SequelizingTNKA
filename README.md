# NEW VERSION OF **TAKE NAMES KICK ASS**

Have you ever got so mad at someone that you wish you could kick their ass, but then suddenly forgot who it was that you were mad at?

Well, that is no longer a problem with this application!

All you have to do is go to the project located here: (https://murmuring-dawn-26874.herokuapp.com/).

* To begin, enter the names of those you remembered have wronged you. Hurry before you forget!
* Then, make sure you select a picture so that you can be reminded of what they look like. Currently, there is a limited amount of pictures. In the future, there will be more, so stay tuned! *It is okay if you don't remember/know what the person looks like, there is an option for no picture available*
* Hit submit! Their picture should show up in the column titled **Take Names** with the button **KICK** under their picture and name.
* When you have successfully kicked their ass, click **KICK**, and they will be moved to the column titled **Asses Kicked**.
	* This section is to remind you that you have kicked this person's ass. That way you don't over-kick asses unnecessarily.

That's it!
Once you have finished using this application, find some new friends using this other application here: http://immense-beyond-78884.herokuapp.com


## UPDATES
* You can let everyone know who kicked who's ass now!
	* All you have to do is enter your name (or select your name from the dropdown, if you have kicked ass before) and then enter the person you are about to kick.
* You can also hover over the pictures of those who had their asses kicked to see who added them to the list.

Enjoy!

Thank you!
